**[Cuneyt Gurcan Akcora](https://cakcora.github.io/), [Selim Coskunuzer](https://github.com/SelimC06)**

This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to Topological Data Analysis (TDA) on networks specifically tailored for Computer Science, Statistics, and Mathematics students. The tutorial is designed to accommodate students with minimal mathematical background, assuming only a basic understanding of concepts such as graphs, nodes, and edges.

We will introduce the fundamental principles of TDA, enabling students to leverage topological techniques for data analysis and exploration. We will cover essential topics such as simplicial complexes, persistence diagrams, and homology, gradually building a strong foundation in TDA concepts and methods.

The instructional approach emphasizes clarity and accessibility, presenting complex mathematical ideas in an intuitive and digestible manner. By the end of this tutorial, you will have gained a solid understanding of TDA and its applications, equipping them with valuable tools for analyzing and interpreting complex datasets.
